## Spending List v.3.0 - Esther Kim

https://a4-estherkim.onrender.com

Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

For this project, I continued building off of my project in a3. In a3, I added express and mongoDB to the initial HTML/CSS/Javascript web application. In this project, I used React to build the User Interface for the index, edit, and spendingList pages, leaving the login and register pages the same. For each HTML page, I created a base jsx file and then a separate jsx file that would actually create the HTML portions, such as dynamically populating tables, and held their respective functions within it to handle interactive portions, such as buttons.

Incorporating React was difficult because I had to change some of the logic as the HTML was being created with Javascript rather than being hardcoded in the HTML files. However, once I started understanding the format of React, it was a lot easier to dynamically create HTML pages using React rather than pure HTML and Javascript alone. Creating the HTML with React gave a lot more flexibility in adding interactive elements to the website. On the other hand, it felt like React was created to work really well with a single page application, so it felt a little awkward building a multi-page application with React.

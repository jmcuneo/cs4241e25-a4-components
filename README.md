## Northstar Cafe Waitlist Form
https://a4-chrislam.onrender.com 

The Northstar Cafe Waitlist Form is a continuation of A3, except it has been implemented in React instead. Using React has been much easier for this assignment. For the dev process, it is a lot easier and readable to do. For example, any front-end (client) side work can stay in one file related to an HTML/JSX page. Anything server side stays in the server file.
I did not have to do any major changes, as I usually just copied it from main.js, and needed to set up some useStates and useEffects. 

During this process, I did have trouble unrelated to this assignment needs. TailwindCSS updated to v4 during Week 3 of this course, meaning that the config. files were being removed and it became a one-liner to use it, however the frameworks have not caught up with it just yet, so I have to do a lot of customization again, as it would not let me use custom variables for color sadly.

Fun assignment though! It will definitely help me within the final project scope.

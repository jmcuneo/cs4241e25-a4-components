## Gymnastics Competition Personal Score Tracker

Hosting Link: https://cs4241e25-a4-katherinetse.onrender.com
- Note about Deployment Link from Render Server: "The instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more."

**Project Summary**: This project is an application that allows gymnasts to store their scores all in one place. To start, users can log into their account to see their data. They can also input their event scores by competition and the application will calculate the total (also known as All-Around) score. Users can delete and edit entries as well. The data is persistent using MongoDB. 

**Instructions**: The current user and login information is listed below:
- Username: ktse
- Password: thisismypassword1

**Changes**: While the UI and user experience did not change, I rewrote all of the front end code, both the login and data display/maniulation, using React. I also added Vite to the server. 

**Improve or Hinder?**: React really does improve functionality in my opinion. It made it a lot easier to share variables between different functions, smplify a lot of functions and reduce redundancy. However, I had an incredibly difficult time deploying the applicaiton. Most of my issue was getting the deployment to properly connect to the files outputted by building, but I was able to figure out how to get it to connect with help from one of my friend/past soft eng team memeber.
